Crack the Sudoku Game! ðŸ§ Sudoku Solver Scanner project Using Deep Learning Models and Computer Vision.

Simplifies the puzzle-solving process step by step:
â€¢ Detect squares within the image.
â€¢ Identify the largest square.
â€¢ Reshape and prepare the square for analysis.
â€¢ Segment the grid into manageable 9x9 squares.
â€¢ Save the segmented squares for further processing.
â€¢ Train a precise digit classification model.
â€¢ Detect digits within each cell, marking empty cells as 0.
â€¢ Employ a recursion  solver function for Sudoku.
â€¢ Display the solved puzzle or indicate 'Unsolved' if necessary.
